# Silatra Hand Pose Recognition

This repository serves to be a demonstration of Hand Pose Recognition from the [Indian Sign Language Translator (Silatra) API](https://github.com/dev-td7/Indian-Sign-Language-Translation "Want to make your own Sign Language Translation application? Here's the Library you'll need!"). It uses Flask as a backend.

_[See the demonstration here](http://18.236.194.220:5000/)_

You should also check out the main project - [Silatra - The Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translator Application](https://github.com/kartik2112/Silatra "This is the backend of Silatra which runs on a remote server") which is an Android application [(Find it's apk here)](https://github.com/DevendraVyavaharkar/SiLaTra-UDP/releases "This is the API you'll install on your Android smartphone") which connects to a python server hosted on an AWS instance for realtime ISL Translation.

This demonstration servers as a purpose to provide a quick insight without directly going through the hassle of installing the application (Which is the real deal, should ceratinly check it out!).

## A brief overview of what you'll expect in this application:
